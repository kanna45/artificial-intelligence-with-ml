Data Source: 
Cricket is hugely popular in India, and the IPL is a major sporting event. You can find IPL data on Kaggle 
or websites like ESPNcricinfo. 
EDA Focus: 
1. Explore team performance over seasons (wins, losses, win percentages). 
2. Analyze individual player statistics (batting averages, bowling strike rates). 
3. Identify trends in match outcomes (home advantage, toss wins). 
4. Visualize key metrics using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. 
Pandas Library Usage: 
pd.read_csv() to load the data. df.groupby() to aggregate data by teams or players. df.describe() to get 
summary statistics. df.corr() to find correlations between variables.
