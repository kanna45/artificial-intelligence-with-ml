Explanation: 
1. 
Sample Data: The data dictionary represents a simplified version of 
IPL data. In a real-world scenario, you would work with a much 
larger dataset with more features (e.g., individual player scores, 
bowling figures, etc.) 
2. Pandas DataFrame: The pd.DataFrame(data) line creates a Pandas 
DataFrame from the dictionary. 
3. EDA: The code demonstrates basic EDA steps: 
⚫ head() and info() to get an initial overview of the data. 
value_counts() to analyze the frequency of wins and player of the match 
awards. 
• mean() to calculate the average runs scored. 
4. Data Visualization: 
⚫sns.countplot() creates a bar chart to visualize team wins. 
• plt.hist() creates a histogram to show the distribution of runs scored. 
Expand the analysis by exploring more features, performing more in-depth 
calculations, and creating additional visualizations.
